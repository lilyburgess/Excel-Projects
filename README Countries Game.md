COUNTRIES GAME
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Aim of the game:

To guess as many countries as you can that begin with each letter

How to play:

1. On the 'Game' sheet, click the button "Click here to generate a letter"
2. A letter will appear the the right of "Name all countries beginning with the letter:"
3. In the grey space underneath this letter, list all the countries you can that begin with the specified letter, giving each country its own row/cell (press Enter to list another country)
4. You do not need to capitalise, but the game will not accept incorrect spellings. A green cell means a correct guess, a red cell means an incorrect guess
5. Use the progress tracker above the game to see how many countries there are with the specified letter, and how many you have left to guess. ""% completed"" shows how close you are to completing the game, and will turn green when you have done so

Answers/a full list of countries are under the 'Countries' sheet

The 'Editing' sheet has information about how to change the sheet
